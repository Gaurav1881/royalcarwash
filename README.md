# royalcarwash

A Java Netbeans desktop application built specifically for The Royal Car Wash on short 2 days notice. They needed a system asap and since I had prior experiance with Netbeans it would be the fastest method of delivery. This application was designed, created, and deployed on their local machine in the span of 48 hours.

This application takes a clients phone number and services then saves that data to that PostgresSQL server.

The user can then go ahead and check how many times a customer has visited the location, as per company promotions, if you get 5 car washes the 6th one is free. This system crutial for tracking the users visits. 

The application currently looks like this:

As the company uses the product and starts to find flaws or unsatisfactory features, those issues are improved along the way.
